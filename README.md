#Python File Handling Assignment
Description
This repository contains two Python scripts demonstrating file handling and exception handling:

file_modifier.py

Reads a file, modifies its content (e.g., converts to uppercase), and saves it to a new file.

error_handler.py

Prompts the user for a filename and handles errors (e.g., missing files, permission issues).

How to Run
bash
python file_modifier.py      # Requires an input file named 'original.txt'  
python error_handler.py      # Interactive filename prompt  

Skills Demonstrated
✔ File I/O (open(), read(), write())
✔ Exception handling (try-except)
✔ Context managers (with statement)
